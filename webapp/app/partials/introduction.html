<h4>Welcome to the Bridge!</h4>

<p class="introduction">NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves) is a collaboration of scientists working to detect and study gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein in his Theory of General Relativity. In his theory, mass distorts space and time. Extreme massive binary systems such as supermassive binary black holes produce gravitational waves. Nanohertz gravitational waves have exceptionally long wavelengths, which is why scientists were unable to build a large enough detector to observe them. However, the Universe provided us with a way about this hindrance in the form of miliseconds pulsars - the rapidly spinning, super dense remnants of massive stars. During their rotation, milisecond pulsars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, which are detected on Earth as one "tick" of a clock. &nbsp;When pulsar signals travel across space to the Earth, signals experience a delay or an advance due to gravitational waves distorting the space. Hence, by studying and analysing pulsar data, we will most likely be able to detect gravitational waves. Today we are still only seeing the Universe through the lens of electromagnetic radiation, and the ability to unravel the gravitational wave data would completely change how we perceive the Universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="introduction">&nbsp;The Bridge is an online portal for PTA (Pulsar Timing Array) data, data products, and data analysis tools. Data products (TOAs, residuals, noise models, and likelihoods of various gravitational wave signals) are available at multiple stages of analysis. Tools are available for use online, and are also available for downloading and running on your local machine.</p>
<p class="introduction">To get started please click the &ldquo;Analysis&rdquo; tab at the top of the page, and simply press &ldquo;Engage&rdquo; which will produce a default set of residual plots. The reason why residual plots are produced is that certain patterns could indicate the existence of gravitational waves.<br />An example of a plot that you might get is shown here (Pulsar J0613-0200):<br /><img style="float: left;" src="/assets/img/J0613-0200.png" alt="Pulsar J0613-0200" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p class="introduction">Explanation of the plot:</p>
<p class="introduction"><strong>TOAs&nbsp;</strong>- TOA ("time of arrival") refers to the time that a radio telescope observed the pulse of a pulsar. TOAs are usually recorded in units of MJDs (Modified Julian Day).</p>
<p class="introduction"><strong>Residuals -&nbsp;</strong>Residuals refer to the difference between the expected TOA (theoretically predicted) and the observed TOA. If a point is located on the zero horizontal line, the expected TOA equals the observed TOA. However, if the point is located above the zero line, that means that the pulse arrived earlier than expected <em>( Residual = TOA(expected)-TOA(observed) )</em>. Naturally, if the point is located below the zero line, the pulse arrived later than expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="introduction">After the residual plots have appeared press &ldquo;Engage analysis&rdquo; and the data will be searched for gravitational waves and the results displayed. This exercise will give you a sense of how the Bridge is run.</p>
<p class="introduction">Now try adjusting some settings and rerunning the analysis. For example, try selecting only a subset of pulsars instead of all of them. Then rerun the analysis on the subset of pulsars. The likelihood of a gravitational wave will decrease. </p>
